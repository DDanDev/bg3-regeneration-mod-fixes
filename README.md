# bg3-regeneration-mod-fixes

While playing Baldur's Gate 3 and using [this Regeneration mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11184/?tab=description&BH=0) I found bugs with it and decided to fix them. I ended up optimizing and rewriting most of it so I am saving this here for others to copy and for the original mod author to get my changes if he wants to.

For users who might want to use it:

Use [BG3 Modders Multitool](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool) or similar to unpack the original mod, then replace BoostrapServer.lua with mine and pack it back.
